                <p>We have done rheological testing, and we have obtained the shear stress for different currents. From that, we have calculated the damping force, later on, used that damping force in quarter car vehicles.</p>
                <p>Model would make significant contribution in improving the reaction time of the overall semi-active suspension system with MR damper.</p>
                <p>A MR damper was formulated by extracting the polynomial expression which represents the dynamic characteristic of the MR damper. This model was used in a quarter car model and its performance in the passive and semi-active suspension was evaluated, and we have achieved a desired result.</p>
                <p>Based on the results obtained in these analyses, it was identified that the parameters served well with the purpose of reducing the acceleration and vertical displacement of sprung mass in all classes of roads to improve the ride comfort and road holding of the vehicle.</p>
